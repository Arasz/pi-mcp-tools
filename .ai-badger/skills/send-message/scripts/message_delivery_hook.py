"""Message-bus delivery hook: inject the session's unread bus mail into its context.

The ONE delivery surface for every hook-shaped harness: Claude (UserPromptSubmit /
SessionStart / SessionEnd), Copilot (userPromptSubmitted / sessionStart), and pi via the
adapter's child-process bridge all speak the same Claude-shaped contract —

    stdin:  {"hook_event_name": "...", "session_id": "...", "cwd": "..."}
    stdout: {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "...", "additionalContext": "..."}}

Delivery events (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, Stop, either harness's spelling) call
``Store.deliver_for_session`` — exactly-once + the 30-minute first-read gate + the
16-message start cap are the store's one transaction, not this script's (P1); the
cursor-less per-turn read applies that gate once too (D5). Stop is Claude's turn-end
event: its ``additionalContext`` continues the turn (host loop-capped), so mail that
arrived mid-work surfaces without another user prompt — and exactly-once keeps that
continuation loop-safe (a second firing finds nothing new). Close events (SessionEnd)
are a no-op (D3): a reused session id (a host's --resume) after a close-time cursor
delete looked like a brand-new session and replayed already-delivered mail (L2-6), so
the cursor now dies only via the 4-day prune. Everything else is a no-op too.

Residual: a fully idle session fires no hook until its next prompt — hooks cannot wake
Claude (no timer surface exists; FileChanged/Notification discard context output per
the Claude Code hooks reference), so mail arriving while idle still waits for the
next turn.

``additionalContext`` carries one schema-conformant message document per line
(``schemas/message.schema.json``, F4) in chronological order — render_messages is the
seam P9-t1 asserts through. A mail-bearing response additionally carries the delivery
transaction's wake classification as ``hookSpecificOutput.aiBadgerBus``
= ``{"addressed": n, "broadcast": m}`` (C2 — merged after build_response, so
``build_response``'s own shape is unchanged). An empty inbox injects nothing and adds
nothing: the response is ``{}`` — exactly.

Fail-open (D31): any store, registry or input failure exits 0 with parseable no-op
JSON — a broken bus must never break a session — and the failure is wire-distinguishable
from a clean empty read: ``{"hookSpecificOutput": {"aiBadgerBus": {"error": true}}}``
(C2b, CR-M1: a poller advancing on a parseable ``{}`` would strand undelivered mail).
The only trace is one line in the operator's hook-error log, because a hook that dies
quietly is indistinguishable from one that did its job.
