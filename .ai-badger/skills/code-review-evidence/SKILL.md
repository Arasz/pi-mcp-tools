# Code Review Evidence

Companion to the mechanical checklist (`code-review-checklist`) and the
risk-ranking skill (`review-changes`). This one is about **whether claims and
tests are evidence at all**. Two failure modes recur:

1. Behavior claims about wrapped third-party code (native SQLite extensions,
   SDKs, CLIs) are taken from the wrapper's comments or the feature spec — both
   of which can be wrong. The wrapper may faithfully translate a spec that
   contradicts the library's real behavior.
2. Integration tests assert values the method under test constructed itself,
   so they pass while the feature is entirely non-functional against the real
   backend.

## Steps


> Step 1 (verify wrapped-code semantics from the upstream source, not the spec): read `references/wrapped-code-evidence.md` when reviewing code that wraps external libs, SDKs, or stores.

 3. **Check integration tests assert observable state, not constructed values.**
   For every integration test over a real backend, ask: *could this test pass
   while the feature does nothing?* If the assertion compares a field of the
   record the method returned (e.g. `result.Context == "shared"` where the
   method built that record), it verifies a constant — re-read the row from the
   store, or run the operation that consumes it (a search, a list). A green
   tautology is the same failure as a missing test.

4. **Read test headers for honest coverage claims.** Tests that explicitly
   skip when the real backend is unavailable (e.g. catch-and-return on native
   extension load) are honest; note what they *don't* cover and cross-check the
   spec's testing table against the actual test list — sections the spec
   promised (search round-trip, deferred embeddings) may exist only as "manual
   test" notes.

5. **Trace acceptance criteria to code, then to evidence.** For each AC:
   feature scenario -> implementation path -> test that would fail if the path
   were reverted. Name the missing test case explicitly when it doesn't exist.

6. **Harness-level QA (a whole suite, not one wrapper).** When the deliverable
   is "would this harness catch a regression in X?", read EVERY test file AND
   the production code it exercises (full pairing, not sampling — the gap is
   usually in the file you'd skip), then:
   - Classify each integration assertion: **tautology** (asserts a field of the
     record the method constructed itself), **weakly-observable** (real
     read-back but insufficient — e.g. content-derived hash equality that a
     duplicate-row regression survives), or **observable** (fresh re-query via a
     different SQL path or a consuming operation).
   - Audit the fakes: do they return data for rows that would not exist in the
     real backend (phantom meta entries, hardcoded ratings for every hash)? Can
     they model the semantics the guarantee depends on (global dedup, global
     delete)? A fake that cannot model the semantics reduces a guarantee test
     (e.g. "shared is sweep-exempt") to a loop-shape check ("shared was never
     queried") that the real backend can still violate.
   - Audit skip honesty: `return;` on an unavailable backend reports PASSED,
     not SKIPPED; a broad catch (any SqliteException around the probe) conflates
     "backend not provisioned" with "backend broken" — the suite is green with
     zero coverage either way. Gate the skip on the missing precondition
     (extension files absent), use Assert.Skip, and let real failures propagate.
   - Flag snapshot/change-detector tests (production SQL/string constants
     asserted against typed-in literal copies): they fail only on a text edit,
     never on executability — and they often omit exactly the statements that
     are broken. List which constants have NO snapshot at all.
   - End with the exact list of new tests the fix batch must add, each named
     `name — asserts — why it catches the bug`; a verdict stating whether the
     harness would catch a regression in each claimed capability is the
     deliverable's spine.


> Step 7 (env-gated and hook/plugin suites): read `references/env-gated-suite-audit.md` when auditing env-gated suites, hook features, or precedent-parity claims.

## Gotchas
- **Dapper scalar queries: affinity decides, not the alias.** For
  `QueryAsync<string>` on a single-column `SELECT x AS Alias`, the alias is
  irrelevant (scalar path — no record-ctor matching); correctness hinges on the
  column's declared type → affinity in CREATE TABLE: TEXT → string works,
  INTEGER → long → `(string)long` cast throws at runtime, BLOB → byte[] → throws.
  Read the schema before verdicting, and confirm a port/contract test runs the
  query against the real database. (The record-ctor alias-matching path is a
  different trap — blob-affinity columns defeated it in this repo's history.)
- **Per-item `catch (Exception)` swallowing OCE in hosted-service loops.** Outer
  loop may have the `catch (OCE) when (stopping.IsCancellationRequested)` idiom
  while the per-item catch inside the loop swallows OCE: shutdown then logs N
  spurious warnings and pays a DB round-trip per remaining item. Also check that
  EVERY awaited read sits inside the try — a settings/interval re-read placed
  after the catch faults `ExecuteAsync`, and the .NET 8+ default
  `BackgroundServiceExceptionBehavior.StopHost` kills the whole host, contradicting
  any "best-effort" doc claim.
- **Config knobs: prove a writer exists.** `git grep <key> <branch> -- src/ tests/ docs/`
  — if the matches are only the const + reads + test fixtures, the knob is dead
  (displayed by `list`, never settable). A verb that advertises an unsettable
  value is a SHOULD-FIX, not a nit.
- **Don't trust `read_file` output that shows `***` in a string literal.** The
  tool masks secret-looking substrings for display; the file on disk may be
  fine (`$"apikey:{apiKey}"` rendered as `apikey:***`). Verify with `sed -n
  'N,Mp' file | od -c` before reporting the file as corrupted or containing a
  literal mask. Note: terminal `grep`/`cat -v` output is masked the same way —
  only `od -c` shows the raw bytes.
- **Global dedup vs per-context rows.** A "promotion" or "share" operation that
  re-inserts the same content into another context is a silent no-op if the
  library dedups by content hash globally. Read the dedup predicate
  (`SELECT ... WHERE hash = ? LIMIT 1` without a context filter = global).
- **Per-connection defaults that persist.** Setting an option on every
  connection open can clobber a persisted setting written by a configure
  operation on an earlier connection — the "configure then it works" path
  breaks only on the *next* connection.
- **NULL binds to strict-argument functions.** A wrapper passing `DBNull` for
  an optional limit/parameter can hit an upstream "expects a positive INTEGER"
  error path that no unit test exercises (fakes never validate).
- **Dead provisioning/wiring.** A downloader/installer class with tests but no
  production caller (and an empty checksum manifest) means "first run" fails;
  grep for the caller before assuming the README's "provisioned on first run"
  claim. Test setup that copies pre-provisioned files into a temp root masks
  the gap — check what the tests set up manually that production never does.
- **Skip that reports PASSED.** Integration tests that `return;` when the real
  backend is unavailable show up as green passes, not skips; a broad exception
  catch makes a broken-but-loadable backend indistinguishable from an absent
  one. Gate the skip on the missing precondition, not on the exception.
- **Fakes that fabricate rows.** A fake returning a rating/entry for hashes
  that would not exist in the real store lets a wrong "missing ⇒ default"
  fallback implementation pass. Make fakes return null for unknown data and
  add a test for the real fallback value.
- **Snapshot tests are change-detectors, not behavior tests.** Asserting
  `MemorySql.X.ShouldBe("...")` against a literal copy never proves the SQL
  executes; it only fails on a text edit. Cross-check which statements have NO
  snapshot and NO behavior test — those are usually the broken ones.
- **Assertion target not connected to the code under test.** A
  `StringWriter`/`MemoryStream`/spy that is created and asserted empty but never
  passed INTO the call can never fail. Classic victim: the "stdout stays clean"
  half of an output-routing test that renders into a *different* writer
  (`stdout.ToString().ShouldBeEmpty()` on an inert writer is vacuously true — it
  passes even if `Render` wrote help to the real stdout). Assert on what the
  writer passed into the call actually received, or redirect the real sink
  (`Console.SetOut`) under a non-parallel collection.
- **Test that does not discriminate against the obvious wrong implementation.**
  Mentally replace the code under test with the plausible regression
  ("configured path ignored, fallback used instead") and ask whether the test
  would still pass. A "custom path is used" test that copies the fixture to the
  custom path passes either way (the fallback also succeeds) — pair it with a
  test that makes the fallback FAIL (missing path must throw); the pair is what
  pins the behavior.
- **Suite-level pre-change sweep (feature reviews).** For every test in a
  feature's new suite, ask "would this test have PASSED against the pre-change
  code?" Tests that pass both before and after the feature are vacuous guards —
  legitimate as regression guards, but they prove nothing about the feature and
  must be labeled as such in the review. Then name the missing discriminating
  combination explicitly: the case where the feature is ACTIVE and the fallback
  path it must replace is simultaneously exercised (e.g. a new render source:
  exclude-all + non-empty local, not just empty-dir no-op; the empty-dir tests
  pass pre-change too). Also flag test NAMES that overclaim their assertion —
  "renders after ALL framework invariants" that only asserts position after one
  of them; a weak assertion behind a strong name reads as evidence it is not
  (observed in the ai-badger #313 project-local-invariants suite: 7 of 9 tests
  discriminated, 2 empty-slot tests passed pre-change as pure guards).
- **Load-bearing fragile pin without a direct test.** A detection idiom pinned by
  type name / reflection (e.g. `parseResult.Action?.GetType().Name ==
  "VersionOptionAction"`) that feeds an early-return flag needs a test asserting
  the FLAG (`Parse(["--version"]).ShowVersion`), not just an end-to-end render
  test — the render path succeeds even when the flag is broken, so a future
  library bump breaks the early-return path with zero failing tests.
- **Row→dict loop that assigns instead of accumulates.** When code folds SQL
  rows into a per-key dict (`by_model[model] = {...}` inside a loop), check
  whether the real table's PRIMARY KEY allows multiple rows per logical key —
  a composite PK (e.g. `(session_id, model, ..., task)`) means the same model
  legitimately appears in several rows (main thread, 'approval',
  'title_generation', 'compression'), and assignment keeps only the LAST row
  in iteration order. One real review: a 2.6M-token model became 350 tokens
  because the 'title_generation' row landed last. The fix is `setdefault` +
  `+=`. Simulate the loop against the real store (`SELECT ... WHERE key = ?`
  in PK order) before accepting the mapping, and check the fake store in the
  tests can even represent multi-row-per-key — a fake table missing the `task`
  column structurally cannot, so the bug is untestable by construction.
- **Exception-pin tests: name what they actually pin.** A canned-transport
  test that throws the real SDK exception type (e.g.
  `CredentialUnavailableException` from the handler's SendAsync) honestly pins
  the MAPPING if that type is what production surfaces on that path — and a
  passing test additionally proves the SDK propagates it unwrapped (Azure.Core
  does not wrap non-HTTP handler exceptions). What it does NOT pin is the
  SDK's own behavior (that DefaultAzureCredential throws
  CredentialUnavailableException on a credential-less machine) — that is SDK
  behavior, probe-verified separately. Say in the review which half the test
  pins instead of claiming it pins the SDK; a synthetic exception type is
  never an honest pin.
- **Negative "required config" test that passes for the wrong reason.** A test
  named "build without `<Section>:<Key>` fails to compose" is evidence only if
  the throw it asserts comes from the guard it claims to pin. Three checks:
  (1) *entry point* — the test must call the registration method that actually
  contains the guard; a guard inside `AddInfrastructure` is never reached by a
  test that calls only `AddApiServices`. (2) *earlier throwers* — does the
  fixture omit some OTHER required input (e.g. `UserAuth`) whose
  `GetRequiredSection` throws first? A vacuous test is green before the change
  AND after the guard is deleted — so a plan's "this negative test was RED
  pre-change" claim is falsifiable exactly this way. (3) *guard semantics* —
  `Get<T>() ?? ThrowHelper(...)` fires only when the WHOLE section is absent.
  A section that exists but is keyless (e.g. a shipped appsettings.json
  carrying model-id defaults without the key) binds successfully with the
  `required` member = null: the .NET ConfigurationBinder does NOT throw for
  missing `required` members (probe-verified net10.0 / Configuration.Binder
  10.0.0). So the realistic deployed failure (Terraform app setting lost → key
  null → fallback client with null key → runtime 401s) is silently unguarded
  even though the section-absent guard exists. The honest fix guards the bound
  VALUE (`if (string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(opts.ApiKey)) throw`) and the negative
  test uses a fixture that satisfies every other required section. Probe
 recipe + worked case (PR #748 OpenRouter swap): read `references/vacuous-negative-guard-tests.md` when a negative test passes for the wrong reason.
 - **Skip on spawn failure under an explicit slow flag.** An integration fixture
 that does `pytest.skip("server failed to spawn")` when the spawned child
 process doesn't come up reports "N passed" while the entire child-process
 path is dead — the suite goes green with zero coverage of the thing it exists
 to test. Skipping when the *precondition* is absent (binary not on PATH) is
 honest; skipping when the *system under test* fails to start is masking.
 With `--run-slow` explicitly requested, spawn failure should `pytest.fail`,
 not skip.
 - **Verify installed-SDK behavior from the installed source, not docs.** For
 MCP/SDK clients, read the venv's site-packages: `grep -n "yield" .../mcp/client/stdio/__init__.py`
 (2-tuple `read_stream, write_stream`) vs `streamable_http.py` (3-tuple
 `read, write, get_session_id`), and read the stdio `__aexit__` finally block
 to confirm child termination (stdin close → graceful wait → SIGTERM→SIGKILL
 escalation). One grep beats any doc or memory of the tuple shape.
 - **Empirically disprove your own suspicion before flagging it.** A code path
 that "should" fail may not: `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(name,
 dir/__init__.py)` sets `__package__` and `__path__` (the file name
 `__init__.py` makes it a package), so `from .client import X` inside a
 spec-loaded plugin works fine. Run the 5-line repro; if it works, drop the
 finding — a false positive costs the review's credibility as much as a
 missed bug.
 - **Stale decision record in a design doc.** A protocol/design doc whose status
 line still says "decisions open" and whose decision table is all dashes —
 while the implementation under review claims the decisions were approved —
 is a doc finding (SHOULD-FIX) independent of implementation fidelity: the
 record is the source of truth, fill it in or the next reviewer cannot tell
 approved decisions from recommendations.
