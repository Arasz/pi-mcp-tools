# Error recovery

Structured JSON error → classify → fix → re-run.

| Error | Fix |
|---|---|
| `config.json` invalid / `validationErrors` present | Read the errors, patch `config.json`, re-run |
| `manifest.json` missing or corrupt | Re-run `welcome-ai-badger` steps 4-5 (validate + scaffold) |
| `index.json` missing or stale | `python3 "$AI_BADGER/tooling/index_build.py"` |
| `frameworkVersion` mismatch between config and framework | Update `frameworkVersion` in config.json to match `cat "$AI_BADGER/VERSION"` |
| Scaffold script raised an exception (file-permission, encoding) | Fix the file/permission issue, retry once |
| Python dependency missing (`jsonschema`) | `python3 -m pip install -r "$AI_BADGER/engine/requirements.txt"` |
| Scaffold and config disagree with `reScaffolded: false` and no drift signal explains why | Re-run with `--force` — re-scaffolds unconditionally and reports `"forced": true` |
