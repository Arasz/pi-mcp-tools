# Security checklist (3.3)

- [ ] **No hardcoded secrets, credentials, or tokens** in any tracked file
- [ ] **Managed credentials preferred over shared keys** — use identity-based
  auth over connection strings, account keys, or shared access signatures
  wherever the platform supports it.
- [ ] **Token/credential storage is encrypted** — secrets at rest use the
  platform's encryption mechanism, not plaintext.
- [ ] **OAuth/SSO flows handle edge cases** — popup-blocked fallback documented,
  token refresh implemented, CSRF tokens have TTL/cleanup.
- [ ] **Nothing secret ships in a client artifact** — a build-time environment
  variable inlined into a bundle, a mobile binary, or anything else the user
  downloads is public. An API key that reaches the client is a leak even though
  it appears in no tracked file.
- [ ] **Authorization is enforced server-side** — a client-side check is UX, not
  a control. Every state-changing request re-authorizes at the API, and hiding a
  button is never the authorization.
- [ ] **Untrusted input never reaches a markup or code-execution sink** — markup
  templating, DOM injection, dynamic evaluation, shell or query construction. The
  value goes through the framework's escaping/parameterised path, or through an
  audited sanitizer at the point of insertion. Nothing is trusted because of
  where it was stored.
- [ ] **Redirect and navigation targets are allowlisted** — a target taken from a
  query parameter, a stored value, or a header is an open redirect until proven
  otherwise; rejecting `javascript:` and `data:` schemes is the floor, not the
  control.
