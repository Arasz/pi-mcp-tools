"""Shared helpers for the /task skill: JSON stores, transcript token parsing, session refs.

Data lives in <project-root>/.ai-badger/task-tracking/ (gitignored):
  executed-tasks.json  — task execution records (session refs, timestamps, state)
  token-usage.json     — per-task token checkpoints, usage deltas, quality grade
  current-session.json — every currently-active session (keyed by sessionId), so multiple
                          concurrent Claude Code sessions can share the file safely — see
                          resolve_own_session().

Project-agnostic: the project root is resolved via `resolve_project_root()` (env var, then a
cwd walk for the `.ai-badger/config.json` contract marker, then a fallback relative to this
file's own location), and every path is then derived from that root via a project-root-relative
`.ai-badger/` tracking convention, never an absolute path baked in at authoring time. This
matters because ai-badger ships `task` as an installable plugin skill: when Claude Code runs it
from its plugin cache (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/ai-badger/ai-badger/skills/task/scripts/`), the
script's own location is nowhere near the user's project, so a naive fixed-depth-from-`__file__`
lookup would misroot. Anything project-specific (build/test commands, source-control platform,
persona routing) lives in the project's `.ai-badger/config.json`, not here.
