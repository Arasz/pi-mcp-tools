"""Shared helpers for the /task skill: the tracking store, transcript token parsing, session refs.

Task family state lives in <project-root>/.ai-badger/task-tracking/tracking.db (ADR-0024),
accessed through the vendored badger_store module: tasks, token_usage, sessions and the
statusline KV rows. The legacy JSON files (executed-tasks.json, token-usage.json,
current-session.json, statusline-*.json) are migration sources: the first write through these
accessors imports and renames them (*.migrated.json, D6), and until then reads merge them with
per-key last-write-wins (D5a) so old surfaces and new code share one store.

Project-agnostic: the project root is resolved via `resolve_project_root()` (env var, then a
cwd walk for the `.ai-badger/config.json` contract marker, then a fallback relative to this
file's own location), and every path is then derived from that root via a project-root-relative
`.ai-badger/` tracking convention, never an absolute path baked in at authoring time. This
matters because ai-badger ships `task` as an installable plugin skill: when Claude Code runs it
from its plugin cache (`~/.claude/plugins/cache/ai-badger/ai-badger/skills/task/scripts/`), the
script's own location is nowhere near the user's project, so a naive fixed-depth-from-`__file__`
lookup would misroot. Anything project-specific (build/test commands, source-control platform,
persona routing) lives in the project's `.ai-badger/config.json`, not here.

# Optional agent-specific session sources. Agent adjustments (features/<agent>/adjustments/)

# registry above. Discovery by filename pattern rather than a fixed name, so any number of
# agents can coexist — and absent all of them, the tracker has no session source at all. The
# import must never fail the tracker over a module that was never installed.
