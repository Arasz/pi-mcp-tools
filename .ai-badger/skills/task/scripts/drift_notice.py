"""Tier 1 drift comparison: scaffold `frameworkVersion` vs. a plugin's own `VERSION`.

Extracted to its own module (rather than left on `session_start_hook.py`, or duplicated) because
two independent scripts need it: `session_start_hook.py` (scaffolded into a consumer's
`.ai-badger/`, no drift responsibility since #24) previously computed it inline, and
`drift_notice_hook.py` (plugin-provided, registered via `hooks/hooks.json`, the only place this
now actually fires — see #24 and ADR-0001 decision 5) needs the same comparison. A shared module
keeps the comparison logic in one place without pulling `drift_notice_hook.py` into
`session_start_hook.py`'s unrelated import graph (`tracker_lib`, `subprocess`, ...).
