# task orchestration skill

Runs one backlog task as a separated, token-tracked unit of work. High-leverage thinking —
planning and the final quality gate — is delegated to a high-reasoning model; implementation
models do the hands-on work; the orchestrating session integrates and tracks everything so a
dead session can be resumed.

**All project specifics come from `.ai-badger/config.json`** — never hardcode a build command,
a persona name, or a repository. Tracking data lives in `.ai-badger/task-tracking/` (gitignored).
Scripts live in this skill's `scripts/`. Read `references/file-schemas.md` before hand-writing or repairing any tracking file — it carries the exact shape of each one.

## When NOT to Use

- A single-file typo fix or one-off question — no tracking, worktree, or delegation needed
- Work the user wants done inline in this session
- Anything where the token-tracked pipeline's overhead exceeds the task — use the plain workflow

## Default Loop

Every task follows one of two effort-level loops. The loop is the spine; the phases below
(Phase 0–6) detail how its steps are executed.

Before starting, **ask the user if this is a low-effort or high-effort task**. When autonomous
(no user to ask), derive the effort after the analyze step — a best-effort estimate matching
effort to task scope.

### Low-effort loop

prepare → analyze → plan → plan review → implementation → review implementation →
apply fixes → pr → gates → close task → reflect → merge

### High-effort loop

prepare → analyze → plan (MoE) → plan review (MoE) → implementation →
review implementation (MoE) → apply fixes → QA: test quality & coverage → pr →
gates → close task → reflect → merge

Integration step: always required in the high-effort variant. Every plan's last package
is the integration package.

### Step definitions

**prepare** — Create isolated worktree from fresh `main`, push branch, create draft PR.

**analyze** — Derive `taskId` (`{repo-alias}-{key}`). Extract scope, constraints, criteria.

**plan** — Split work into **packages** (mergable units) and **subpackages**. Last package is the
**integration package** with cross-package tests. Every package has ACs; plan AC: all checked+met.

**plan review (MoE)** — High-effort: MoE panel (3 experts, subject-matched). At least one expert
different from plan authoring.

**implementation** — Code phase per persona routing. TDD mandatory.

**review implementation** — Low-effort: single subagent. High-effort: MoE panel (3 experts, at
least one different from plan MoE).

**QA: test quality & coverage** — High-effort only. Assess test honesty and coverage gaps.

**apply fixes** — Fold review findings into code. Trivial directly, larger via subagent. Re-run
build/test.

**pr** — Prepare PR for review, ensure CI runs.

**gates** — Per-repo gates from `config.json` (`commands.build/test/lint`). Default: local full
suite. Check CI state before running.

**close task** — Close tracking, remove clean worktree, update state files.

**reflect** — Check memory, semantica, session history. Distil durable facts. Promote to shared
context.

**merge** — Final PR merge.

### Task-ID derivation

`taskId` is **derived during the analyze step**. Formula:

    {repo-alias}-{key}

- **repo-alias:** Constant per repo. Examples: `jsaa`, `aib`, `air`, `ahp`. Determined by checking
  `config.json`'s `sourceControl.repoAlias`, memory, or deriving from repo name.
- **key:** 5 words conveying purpose. Hyphenated lowercase slug.

Example: `aib-default-loop`.

## Config contract (read first)

From `.ai-badger/config.json`:
- `commands.build` / `commands.test` / `commands.lint` — the verification commands for Phase 4.
- `personaRouting` — maps kinds of work to the scaffolded personas; drives Phase 3 dispatch.
- `sourceControl` — platform + repo/project URLs; **gates the source-control extension** (PR
  flow, review loop, issue/board integration). If `sourceControl.platform == "github"` and a
  `repoUrl` is present, this skill's `extensions/github/` fragment is active — follow it for the
  PR/review-loop steps below. Otherwise commit locally and integrate per your platform.

## Model & delegation policy

Spend high-reasoning capacity on plans and reviews, not implementations. Obtain reasoning via
delegation, not by assuming your own model.

- **Delegate to a high-reasoning agent** for planning (Phase 2) and the quality gate (Phase 4).
- **Delegate to implementation agents** per `config.json`'s `personaRouting`. TDD mandatory.
- **Delegate trivial mechanical work** (doc updates, rote refactors, test backfills) to a cheap model.
- **The orchestrating session does directly:** fetch the task, read docs, record token usage,
  per-subagent completion checks, build/test, and tiny surgical fixes.
- The ten prompting rules govern every brief. Read `references/prompting-rules.md` before composing briefs.

Roles, not models. Which concrete model fills each is bound by the agent-specific extension.

Subagent prompts must be self-contained: scope, ACs, files, TDD rules, report-back shape. Parallelise
independent subagents. **Split work so it *can* run in parallel** — name shared-file sections
(serialise) vs disjoint ones (parallel).

**Isolate every agent, at every depth: its own worktree and its own workspace id.** Disjoint files
are not isolation — shared build output means a green run proves nothing. Two levels max.

**Write the brief so the lane can improve on it.** Before dispatching an end-to-end lane, read
`references/lane-dispatch-brief.md`.

**Reach for what exists.** A code graph, MCP server, or existing skill beats writing from scratch.

**If you cannot spawn subagents**, work directly in-session. Note reduced rigor in your summary.

## Phase 0 — Context hygiene

1. `python3 .ai-badger/skills/task/scripts/task_tracker.py status`. If a previous task is unfinished, finish or park it.
2. Confirm `.ai-badger/state.json` reflects the last finished task; repair if not.
3. If this session carries heavy history, tell the user to `/compact` (or start fresh) and
   re-invoke `/task <id>` on a clean context, then stop — unless autonomous.

## Phase 1 — Start

Entry: previous task finished or parked; clean-enough context.
Exit: effort level chosen, tracker STARTED, worktree exists, five preflight blocks present,
research record gathered, taskId derived.

1. **Determine effort level.** Ask user low or high. When autonomous, derive after analyze.
2. **Analyze the task.** Resolve the task (issue URL or freeform scope/title). Read referenced docs.

   **Derive the taskId** per the derivation formula. Determine repo alias
   (check `config.json`'s `sourceControl.repoAlias`, memory, or derive from repo name).
   Compose the key from 5 words conveying purpose. Validate uniqueness vs existing entries.

   **If the argument is a path to a `spec.json` written by `create-task-spec`,** read it and its
   companion `.feature` file instead of treating the path as a title: the manifest supplies the
   scope, out-of-scope, constraints and deferred decisions, and the spec supplies the acceptance
   criteria. Feed both to the planning agent in Phase 2, and hold the non-deferred scenarios as
   Phase 4's pass condition.

   **Preflight checklist** (Rule 1): confirm the brief has objective, constraints, known unknowns,
   output contract, and stop condition. Fill missing blocks from review or ask the user.
3. Register: `python3 .ai-badger/skills/task/scripts/task_tracker.py start <taskId> --title "<title>" --branch task/<taskId>-<slug>`.
4. Ask the user to rename the session to match the task (skip if autonomous).
5. **Work in the worktree `start` just created** — it prints the path, and it is
   `.ai-badger/worktrees/<taskId>` on the branch you passed to `--branch`. Every command for
   the rest of the task runs there, not in the main checkout.

   This step used to read "create/switch to the task branch". `start` records the branch name
   without creating anything — on 2026-08-01 that put two commits on `main`. `--no-worktree`
   reverts to the old behaviour.

   A worktree is also what makes concurrent sessions safe. Sessions sharing one checkout let
   a second agent switch branches mid-run — the same day: a push failed because the tree moved
   to `main` while its tests ran.
5. **Research before you plan, and plan the review first** (`evidence-first-research`
   formalises the method for non-trivial tasks; dispatch it rather than re-describing it).
   Write down what has to be checked to answer the task — every point in the request, and
   which of them need research rather than a guess. Then run that review and gather the
   evidence into a research record where every finding cites its source path and every
   unverified claim is labelled a hypothesis. A plan written before this record exists is a
   guess with a table around it. When several independent angles need evidence, run them as
   parallel read-only lanes and consolidate per `multi-lane-report-assembly`.

## Phase 2 — PLANNING

Entry: research record exists with sources cited.
Exit: reviewed plan; every point carries criteria and a gate; parallelism named; plan split
into packages and subpackages.

1. **Plan from what the research found.** Delegate decomposition to a high-reasoning agent (the
   `architect` persona), feeding it the task body, the research record and doc excerpts.

   **Split the plan into packages.** Each package is a unit of work delivering a mergable piece.
   Subpackages are partial units within a package. Every package contains its test scenarios.
   The **last package is always the integration package** — it ensures all packages are
   correctly integrated and includes cross-package integration tests. Each package has its own
   acceptance criteria; the plan's top-level acceptance criterion is: *all packages' ACs are
   checked and met*.

   In the **low-effort** variant, a single high-reasoning agent creates the plan.
   In the **high-effort** variant, delegate to an MoE panel (default 3 experts) matching the
   task's subject area.

   Split the plan into sections that can be worked independently, and say which may run at the
   same time. Parallelism has to be designed in; it does not arrive on its own.

   **Every point carries acceptance criteria and a quality gate** — what must be true, and the run
   that proves it. A point without them is a wish. Where a point needs a specification or a design
   before it can be built, produce one, and look for an installed skill that formalises that shape
   before writing a bespoke document. Before the first failing test, run `design-tests` on the
   acceptance criteria — the test list is part of the plan, not of the implementation.
2. **Plan review before dispatch.** In the **low-effort** variant, hand the drafted plan to a
   second high-reasoning agent for review. In the **high-effort** variant, delegate to an MoE
   panel (default 3 experts, at least one different from the plan-authoring experts) and have it
   attack structure, feasibility, budget arithmetic, and testability. Fold MUST/SHOULD findings
   back into the plan before any implementation dispatch. This is the same join discipline
   Phase 4 applies later, applied early where a defect costs least. When consolidating reviewed
   plan sections into lane briefs, follow `references/lane-dispatch-brief.md` — sections sharing
   a file serialise, the rest parallelise.

## Phase 3 — Execute

1. Dispatch implementation subagents per `personaRouting`. Instruct every code subagent to write
   the failing test first (TDD).

   **Operator contract** (Rule 4): each agent brief must include tool names, abort criteria,
   success predicate, and handoff conditions. Persona prose is optional, one short line only.
2. Record each subagent's `total_tokens` on completion:
   `python3 .ai-badger/skills/task/scripts/task_tracker.py subagent <taskId> <total_tokens> --description "<what it did>"`.
   To record a delegation by id instead of a manual count, pass `--delegation <id>`; the
   session source that owns the task decides how the delegation's tokens are read. The two
   are mutually exclusive.
3. Review each result at the seams (matches plan? acceptance criteria?). Send follow-ups back
   rather than rewriting, unless the fix is a few lines.
4. Commit and push per work package (small commits). If the source-control extension is active,
   open a draft PR early per `extensions/github/`.

## Phase 4 — Quality gate

Entry: all plan points implemented and committed in the worktree.
Exit: CI green (or documented local-gate equivalent); review findings fixed or filed; QA
test quality reviewed (high-effort variant).

1. Run the configured `commands.build` and `commands.test` yourself and capture output.
2. **Review implementation.** In the **low-effort** variant, delegate review to a
   high-reasoning agent (the `code-reviewer` persona) with the diff, acceptance criteria,
   relevant architecture docs, and the build/test output. In the **high-effort** variant,
   delegate to an MoE panel (default 3 experts, at least one different from the plan MoE
   and plan review MoE). Ask it to judge implementation correctness (logic, edge cases, test
   honesty) and architecture (layer purity, consistency with docs).
3. **QA: test quality & coverage** (high-effort variant only). After the implementation review,
   delegate a dedicated quality assessment of test coverage and test honesty — can the tests
   actually fail? Are there gaps in coverage? See `review-tests` skill.
4. **Apply fixes.** Fix findings (trivial yourself, substantial via a subagent), re-run
   build/test, then proceed. If the diff adds or changes test files, also delegate
   `review-tests` on those files to `qa` (or the stack's `qa-backend`/`qa-frontend`) and treat
   a `blocker` finding the same as a red build. Docs-only tasks with no test changes skip
   `review-tests`; projects without CI fall back to the full local lane set as the pass
   condition. When push, CI, or PR trouble arises during this phase, follow the `git-work`
   skill before improvising.

### Review every join, not just every part

Each time work is combined — review findings into a plan, sections into one change, branches
into one PR — check the combination. Parts that pass alone fail together: two branches pick
the same version, one renames what another calls, a guard passes on each half and fails whole.

Run checks against the combined result, not the pieces.

**Then stop checking.** Execute the plan rather than re-reading it. A third pass over your own
reasoning finds less than the first and costs the same. Re-verify after integration only when
something changed, a claim is load-bearing, or a check has never been seen to fail. **Facts
are the exception**: anything from docs, an earlier run, or another's research gets re-checked
every time — that is what goes stale while your reasoning stays put.

### The slow suites

The pre-push hook runs the checks that cost seconds; the slow ones belong to CI on every
push. **CI is the gate** — treat its result as this phase's pass condition, not the green
pre-push. Run a slow lane yourself before pushing only as the sole active session. See
`references/prompting-rules.md` for why slow lanes live in CI.

## Phase 5 — Finish protocol

Entry: Phase 4 exit held.
Exit: merged, state updated, tracking closed.

1. If the source-control extension is active, follow `extensions/github/` for PR-ready, the
   review-round loop, and squash-merge. Otherwise integrate per your platform.
2. **Update state files:** prepend the finished task's lean entry to `.ai-badger/state.json`'s
   `completedTasks`, refresh `next`/`lastUpdated`; write verbose notes/decisions to the
   project's notes file.
3. Compaction check on CLAUDE.md if the project tracks one.
4. Close tracking: `python3 .ai-badger/skills/task/scripts/task_tracker.py finish <taskId>`. This
   also removes the task's worktree — **unless it still holds work that exists nowhere else**, in
   which case it refuses, says what it found, and leaves the directory alone. Read the
   `worktree.keptBecause` field in the output; a kept worktree means something is unmerged or
   uncommitted, not that failed cleanup. Resolve it and re-run, or pass `--keep-worktree` when you
   are deliberately leaving it in place.
5. **Reflect.** Examine what was learned during this task. Check AiRaccoon memory for the
   current workspace, query semantica entries if available, and review the session history.
   Distil: what should be remembered as durable facts? Write any cross-task learnings to
   memory. Promote high-value entries to shared context if applicable. Record decisions in
   semantica.
6. Ask the user to grade the skill 0–5: `python3 .ai-badger/skills/task/scripts/task_tracker.py grade <taskId> <0-5>`
   (skip/leave unset if autonomous).
7. Report the task's token cost and recommend `/compact` or a fresh session before the next
   task — this is the default ending. **Authorized auto-continue** (alternative path, only when
   an observable condition holds: the `auto-wm` skill's autonomic/partner mode is active, or the
   user's original invocation explicitly said to continue to the next task): after Phase 6
   completes, compact per Phase 0 guidance, read the next task from `.ai-badger/state.json`'s
   `next` field (or the next unclaimed item on your configured backlog source), and invoke this
   skill again for that task. If neither condition holds and no user is available, start a fresh
   session and tell the user to re-invoke the skill so the next task starts on a clean context.

## Phase 6 — Documentation-gap audit

After integration, delegate a doc-audit agent (worktree-isolated) to check CLAUDE.md and the
project's docs against the merged code, fix small drift, and report gaps needing a decision.

## Gotchas

- **`start` with `--no-worktree` records a branch name nothing creates.** `status` then reports a
  branch that does not exist (2026-08-01: two commits landed on `main`).
- **`finish` refuses and keeps the worktree when it holds work that exists nowhere else.** Read the
  `worktree.keptBecause` field; a kept worktree is unmerged or uncommitted work, not failed cleanup.
- **Never rewrite always-loaded context files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.ai-badger/state.json`) mid-task.** Cache
  reads depend on byte-stable prefix (~10× cost); rewrite only between tasks.
- **Two levels of dispatch, no deeper.** A widening agent tree starves the machine.
- **Isolated = per-agent worktree + per-agent workspace id.** Shared build output defeats isolation.

## Recovery

`task_tracker.py` records the task's session id and resume command. Pass `--cron` to `start` to
install a resume cron. After resume, run `task_tracker.py reattach <taskId>` first, then continue.

Each phase's Entry/Exit lines above are the checklist; this list carries only the
machine-run gates that close the task.

- [ ] `python3 .ai-badger/skills/task/scripts/task_tracker.py status` shows the task finished and `.ai-badger/state.json` reflects it
- [ ] All work lives in the worktree `start` created — no stray commits on the main checkout's branch
- [ ] Every plan point's acceptance gate ran; plan was split into packages with the last being integration
- [ ] Task-ID derived per the `{repo-alias}-{key}` formula and is unique
- [ ] Effort level was determined (low or high) before implementation began
- [ ] High-effort tasks ran QA test quality & coverage step
- [ ] `reflect` step examined memory, semantica, and session history for learnings
