"""Report how a scaffolded project has diverged from the framework catalog.

Tier 2 of ADR-0001 decision 5: the expensive per-entry hash walk, run explicitly.
Tier 1 (the cheap version comparison) lives in the task skill's SessionStart hook,
because welcome-ai-badger is plugin-only and is not scaffolded into a project.

Newly-added catalog items are found by `detect_new_items`, which walks index.json for the
stacks a re-scaffold would actually deliver (`badger_lib.resolve_stacks`, so the always-on
`common` stack is included).

Directory-valued entries (every skill) are compared source-to-source, against the
`sourceHash` scaffold recorded — the scaffolded copy is rendered output and answers only
whether the project edited it, which is reported apart as "locallyModified" (#110). A
manifest written before `sourceHash` existed is reported as "skipped": it has no recorded
source to compare against.

Known limitation, accepted rather than solved: an upstream rename reads as "removed",
because a manifest entry's source is a path with no forwarding record.

Exit code 0 == no drift, 1 == drift found, 2 == usage error. Skipped and locally-modified
entries alone do not count as drift.
