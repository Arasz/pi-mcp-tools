"""MCP servers, one of the scaffold's collaborators.

Collects the servers the mcp catalog declares — `stack-mcp.json` and nothing else since
ADR-0014 step 8 — and writes them into the three project config files ai-badger owns:
`.mcp.json` (Claude Code's project config; the Copilot CLI reads it too), the Copilot CLI's
repo-committed `.github/mcp.json` (#189), and `.pi/mcp.json`, the project config native pi
reads in a trusted project (F1). Every user-global destination is proposed and never written
(ADR-0014 decision 6) — `~/.claude/settings.json` here, `~/.hermes/config.yaml` in the Hermes
adjustment. A server named by `config.mcp.decline` is not declared at all, and is removed
from any file an earlier run wrote it into (#186).

`.mcp.json` and `.github/mcp.json` merge by update (ai-badger's rendering wins on refresh).
`.pi/mcp.json` merges by union under F10/F11/F11a: an entry already present survives a
re-scaffold byte-identical, including its exposure/toolExposure tuning, user-added servers
are never dropped, and today's template governs new entries only.

The Copilot CLI reads **both** of its project files — `.github/mcp.json` and `.mcp.json`,
looked up from the cwd upward — and their precedence is undocumented, so one server described
twice has no knowable configuration. The two entries are therefore identical apart from
destination-specific fields, and a server whose two renderings cannot be reconciled is
declared once, in `.mcp.json`, and named in a note (#193).
