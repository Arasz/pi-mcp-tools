"""MCP servers, one of the scaffold's collaborators.

Collects the servers the mcp catalog declares — `stack-mcp.json` and nothing else since
ADR-0014 step 8 — and writes them into the two project config files ai-badger owns:
`.mcp.json` and `.github/mcp.json`, the Copilot CLI's repo-committed config (#189). Every
user-global destination is proposed and never written (ADR-0014 decision 6) —
`~/.claude/settings.json` here, `~/.hermes/config.yaml` in the Hermes adjustment. A server
named by `config.mcp.decline` is not declared at all, and is removed from either file if an
earlier run wrote it (#186).

The Copilot CLI reads **both** project files — `.github/mcp.json` and `.mcp.json`, looked up
from the cwd upward — and their precedence is undocumented, so one server described twice has no
knowable configuration. The two entries are therefore identical apart from destination-specific
fields, and a server whose two renderings cannot be reconciled is declared once, in `.mcp.json`,
and named in a note (#193).
