"""Rule 6B: reasoning-scaffold linter.

Scans .md and .json instruction files for chain-of-thought anti-patterns that
instruct the model to reason step-by-step rather than producing a direct answer.

Exit 0 — clean (no anti-patterns found).
Exit 1 — one or more anti-patterns found; each printed as file:line:match.
