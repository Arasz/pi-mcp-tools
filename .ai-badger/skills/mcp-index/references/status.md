# Server status — why a silent server is still in the index

Each `sources[]` entry records what the host's last listing supported. A zero-tool server used to
be dropped at write time, which made "switched off" and "running but exposing nothing" the same
absence with opposite remedies (ADR-0014 decision 7).

| `status` | what the listing said | remedy |
|---|---|---|
| `ok` | the server reported tools | none |
| `disabled` | the host says the server is switched off | enable it (`hermes mcp configure`) |
| `empty` | enabled, asked, exposed nothing | check the server actually starts |
| `unknown` | the listing carried no tool detail at all | see below |
| `absent` | the host no longer lists the server; its tools are marked `removed` | re-add it, or accept the removal |
| `unauthenticated` | `claude mcp list` said `! Needs authentication` | `claude mcp login <server>` |
| `unreachable` | `claude mcp list` said `✘ Failed to connect` | fix the endpoint or the credentials it names |
| `pending_approval` | `claude mcp list` said `⏸ Pending approval` — an unapproved `.mcp.json` server, not connected to | approve it in the host |

`unknown` is the honest reading of a listing with no tool detail: the `hermes mcp list` text table
(its Tools column reads `all`, never the tool names) and a `claude mcp list` server that is merely
`✔ Connected`. An `update` over such a listing restates statuses and **does not** mark anything
removed — "not asked" is not "exposes nothing".

The status enum is additive, and a status is added only once a host CLI is *observed* reporting it:
the four phrases above are what `claude mcp list` produced on a 2026-07 install and what its own
`--help` documents. Its other documented phrases (`Connection error`, `Rejected`, `not configured`)
are not mapped, and a phrase this release does not know reads as `unknown` rather than inventing a
distinction the data cannot support.
