# pi-mcp-tools

Universal MCP tools extension for the pi coding agent — connects to MCP servers and registers their tools for the LLM

> Domain: Developer tooling: MCP server bridge for the pi coding agent
> Stacks: github, node, ts
> Scaffolded by ai-badger 0.184.1. Source of truth for this file: `.ai-badger/HERMES.md`.

## Commands

- `build`: `npm run build`
- `test`: `npm run test`
- `lint`: `npm run lint`

## Path-specific instructions

Before editing matching files, read the applicable scoped instruction file:

- `docs/**/*.md,README.md,CLAUDE.md` → `.ai-badger/instructions/documentation.instructions.md`
- `**/.github/workflows/*.yml,**/.github/workflows/*.yaml` → `.ai-badger/instructions/github-actions.instructions.md`
- `**/package.json,**/bun.lock,**/*.mjs,**/*.cjs` → `.ai-badger/instructions/node.instructions.md`
- `**/*.ts,**/*.tsx,**/tsconfig.json` → `.ai-badger/instructions/typescript.instructions.md`

Additional invariants load contextually via these paths — see `.ai-badger/invariants/` for the full set.

## Agent delegation

- MCP server integration and tool adapter development → `architect`
- TypeScript/pi extension API changes, test fixes → `frontend-api-engineer`
- Every dispatch names its `model` — the delegation map is `.ai-badger/delegation.md`.
- Parallel dispatches each name their own `isolation` — lanes sharing a tree share its build output.

## Hermes-specific guidance

This project is configured for Hermes Agent. The `.ai-badger/` directory is the source of truth
for all agent configuration.

### Skills

Framework skills live under `.ai-badger/skills/`. Load them in-session with `/skill <name>` or
preload with `hermes -s <name>`. Key skills:

- `task` — task orchestration: TDD, PR flow, review loop, token tracking
- `prompt-markers` — `h:`, `f:`, `e:`, `q:`, `i!:` prefix markers (see below)

### Memory

Hermes persistent memory is available. Use it to save durable facts about the project:
user preferences, environment details, recurring conventions. Do NOT save transient
task progress or TODOs — use `session_search` for that.

### Subagent delegation

Use `delegate_task` for parallel subtasks. The `task` skill adapts its orchestration
pattern for Hermes: plan with `role='orchestrator'`, implement with leaf agents.
Prefer `delegate_task` over spawning separate `hermes` processes for quick subtasks.

### Context file discovery

Hermes reads project context files in priority order (first match wins):
1. `.hermes.md` / `HERMES.md` — walks parents to git root
2. `AGENTS.md` — cwd only
3. `CLAUDE.md` — cwd only

This file (HERMES.md) is at priority 1 and is the authoritative project context for
Hermes agents working in this repo.

## Prompt markers

This project understands prompt markers (see `.ai-badger/skills/prompt-markers`):

- `h:` / `hint:` — a lead to validate before acting (research first).
- `f:` / `feedback:` — a high-priority correction; adjust immediately.
- `e:` / `extension:` — a request to expand the current task's scope.
- `q:` / `queue:` — a queued instruction to analyze and run after active work completes.
- `i:` / `important:` — important: high priority, do not drop it; handle at the next natural boundary.
- `i!:` / `important!:` — immediate emergency interrupt: STOP, pause/cancel active tasks, and react instantly.

Every marker accepts an **importance token**: insert `!` before the colon (`f!:`, `queue!:`) to make that marker interrupt-grade — preempt current work and handle it first. On pi the session-signals extension aborts the running turn for you; here, treat a `!`-marker as preempting whatever is in flight — never queue it silently behind work already running.

A marker is expanded by a `UserPromptSubmit` hook, which fires only when a message **starts a turn**. A message sent **mid-turn** — queued while work is already running — reaches the model as an attachment and never passes through that hook, so its marker is never expanded. Apply the behaviour above yourself whenever you see a marker arrive that way.

<!-- code-review-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: code-review-graph

**This project has a knowledge graph. Reach for the code-review-graph MCP tools before
Grep/Glob/Read** — they cost fewer tokens and return structural context (callers, dependents,
test coverage) that file scanning cannot. Start at `semantic_search_nodes_tool`; fall back to
Grep/Glob/Read only where the graph doesn't reach. Each tool's own description covers the rest.

<!-- ai-raccoon MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: ai-raccoon

AiRaccoon is the project memory server. Search memory FIRST — before web search, code search, or
asking the user — with `memory_search` (projectId, scope=all) and 2-3 query formulations. Entries
carry source paths, so a decisive hit is evidence: cite it. Escalate by result — a partial hit gets
one targeted external search; no hit means search externally, then write the finding back with
`memory_write` including the source path.

Every call passes projectId. Plain writes land in committed project memory; active workspaces
isolate in-progress notes and consolidate on finish; `memory_share` promotes durable cross-project
facts. Keep the docs directory searchable: check `memory_watch_status`, then `memory_watch_add`
(projectId + absolute path) when no watch exists.

<!-- semantica MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: semantica

Semantica is the project knowledge graph. It complements AiRaccoon: AiRaccoon answers
"what do we know?"; Semantica answers "how are things connected?" and "why was this
decision made?".

Start with `get_graph_summary` for orientation. Record architectural decisions with
`record_decision`. Drill into specifics with `query_decisions`, `find_precedents`, or
`get_causal_chain`. Each tool's own description covers the rest.

<!-- Playwright MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: playwright

The Playwright MCP server provides browser automation capabilities through the Model
Context Protocol, enabling LLMs to interact with web pages using structured accessibility
snapshots without requiring vision models.

Start with `browser_navigate` to load the target URL. Use `browser_snapshot` to capture the
page's accessibility tree and element reference IDs (`ref=...`). Interact with elements using
`browser_click`, `browser_type`, `browser_fill_form`, or `browser_select_option` referencing
those IDs. Capture visual evidence with `browser_take_screenshot`. Monitor API calls with
`browser_network_requests` and debug issues with `browser_console_messages`. For multi-step
or complex interactions, execute custom Playwright scripts with `browser_run_code_unsafe`.
Each tool's own description covers the rest.

<!-- task-graph MCP tools -->
## MCP Tools: task-graph

`task-graph` owns the decomposed task plan — a DAG of `step`s carrying status, acceptance criteria and evidence, persisted beside the task tracker in the project's `tracking.db`.

Plan time: `plan_create` validates and stores the DAG; `plan_replace` revises it before
execution starts; `steps_ready` returns the dispatchable frontier and its waves. Execution:
`step_start`, `step_complete` (evidence + AC results), `step_fail`, `step_skip`, `ac_check`;
`progress_checklist` is the status view, and `plan_get`, `step_get`, `plan_export` read back.

Launched as `uv run --script .ai-badger/skills/task-decomposition/scripts/task_graph_server.py`
(`uv` on PATH; the PEP 723 env is fetched on first launch). No project `.mcp.json` (Hermes,
worktree sessions) → use the CLI twin: `task_graph_cli.py <tool> --json`. Hermes operators:
add the proposed `mcp_servers:` entry to `~/.hermes/config.yaml`, anchoring the script path to
the project root — the declaration is project-relative.



## Non-negotiable invariants

- **Announce parallel work** — When another agent session shares the project, announce started work, opened PRs, review requests and merges on the project bus — read `multi-agent-communication` when parallel work is active.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/announce-parallel-work.md`

- **Diagrams default to Archify** — Author architecture, workflow, sequence, data-flow and lifecycle diagrams with the `archify` skill when it is installed.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/archify-diagrams.md`

- **Ask if a simpler shape would do** — Before calling any design or change finished, ask whether it is over-engineered and what the simpler version would look like.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/ask-if-simpler.md`

- **Check the source, not your own reasoning** — Re-read the docs, the data and the code before stating a fact about them — those are what go stale, get misremembered, or change under you.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/check-sources-not-yourself.md`

- **Consolidated restart** — After two failed revision turns, restart the task with a single merged prompt instead of continuing the same thread and compounding drift.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/consolidated-restart.md`

- **Critical instruction placement** — Keep the most important requirements in the first or last block of the prompt; do not bury them in the middle where they are easy to miss.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/critical-instruction-placement.md`

- **Derive the list, or delete it** — A hand-maintained list meant to mirror something else — the gates on disk, the copies of a helper, the skills in the catalog — drifts the moment someone adds to one side and not the other, and nothing notices because nothing compares them.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/derive-or-delete-the-list.md`

- **Few-shot only for format** — Start zero-shot and use examples only when the output format is the failure mode; otherwise the task should be solvable from the specification alone.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/few-shot-format-only.md`

- **Final output schema separation** — Keep free-form reasoning separate from the final output schema and emit the schema last so the output is auditable and machine-checkable.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/final-output-schema-separation.md`

- **Grounded feedback** — Every correction must cite failing checks, compiler output, validator output, or source evidence before proposing a new patch.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/grounded-feedback.md`

- **Guard clauses over hand-rolled null checks** — Prefer a dedicated guard/throw-helper for argument validation over hand-rolled `x ?? throw ...` or ad hoc `if (x == null) throw` blocks — a guard reads as intent, not boilerplate, and keeps the exception type/message consistent across the codebase.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/guard-clauses.md`

- **Measure only when the measurement pays** — Run your own benchmark or experiment when the time it costs is repaid by the decision it settles, and not otherwise.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/measure-when-it-pays.md`

- **Minimal comments** — Write a doc comment as the 1-3 line contract an editor shows on hover — what the thing is and how to use it — and never let a PR, issue or ticket reference appear anywhere in it.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/minimal-comments.md`

- **Let git write git's own storage** — Write a git dir through `git config`, `git remote` and `git branch --set-upstream-to`, each of which takes the config lock and rewrites only the key it was given.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/never-hand-edit-the-git-dir.md`

- **Use platform security APIs** — Always use the platform's built-in security and crypto APIs.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/no-hand-rolled-crypto.md`

- **Store secrets outside tracked files** — Keep credentials, connection strings, API keys, and tokens in environment variables, secret managers, or user-scoped config.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/no-hardcoded-secrets.md`

- **One-turn specification** — State the objective, constraints, data sources, and success criteria in the first turn; keep the final ask last so the prompt is explicit and executable without a long back-and-forth.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/one-turn-specification.md`

- **Run what you changed; the pipeline runs the rest** — Run the build and the tests your change touches, and let the pipeline run everything else — a full local sweep buys no coverage the pipeline does not already have and spends the same time twice.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/pipeline-runs-the-rest.md`

- **Plain names** — Name things with the simplest accurate word — variables, functions, types, files, folders, flags.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/plain-names.md`

- **Positive constraints and validation** — Prefer positive requirements and validator-backed checks over long negative instruction lists; specify the expected outcome and the validation gate directly.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/positive-constraints-and-validation.md`

- **One PR per task** — Every unit of work ends in a pull request; never push directly to the main/trunk branch.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/pr-per-task.md`

- **Done means proven** — Every unit of planned work carries its acceptance criteria and the gate that checks them, named before the work starts.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/proof-of-done.md`

- **A check you have not seen fail is not a check** — Put the defect a gate, test or acceptance criterion exists to catch in front of it, watch it go red, take the defect away and watch it go green — a check that has only ever passed is indistinguishable from one whose comparison can produce a single answer that looks like success.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/prove-the-check-fails.md`

- **Reasoning scaffolding minimization** — Avoid step-by-step CoT plans on modern reasoning models unless the task is genuine symbolic reasoning; state the goal and constraints instead of narrating the process.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/reasoning-scaffolding-minimization.md`

- **Screaming architecture** — Organize folders and modules by domain/business concept, not by generic technical bucket.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/screaming-architecture.md`

- **Small commits, early draft PR** — Commit one coherent work package at a time and push often.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/small-commits-early-draft-pr.md`

- **Route state transitions through a state machine** — Where a domain object has explicit states, make the declared transitions the only way it moves between them, and record what triggered each move.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/state-transitions-through-a-machine.md`

- **TDD is mandatory** — Write a failing, behavior-focused test before any production code change.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/tdd-mandatory.md`

- **Run each suite once; CI runs the rest** — Normal flow runs the modified surface's suite once — plus the suites of anything that consumes the changed behavior, so an API change pulls the frontend end-to-end that exercises it — and leaves the full suite to CI on push.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/test-run-economy.md`

- **Tests are designed before they are written, and judged after** — Green is the floor, not the evidence: a test list comes out of the acceptance criteria before the first test is written (`design-tests`, each row naming the failure mode it targets and the mutation that proves it real), and a change that adds or alters tests is not done until something other than its author has run `review-tests` and asked whether that suite could have gone red.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/tests-are-designed-and-reviewed.md`

- **Tool schema and success criteria outrank persona prose** — Define explicit tool contracts, required parameters, stop conditions, and success predicates before polishing role text; in short-horizon work, a clear schema plus outcome check beats a clever persona.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/tool-schema-success-criteria.md`

- **Releases are traceable** — Every release records the version it went out at and what changed in it, using whatever version marker and release notes this project already keeps.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/traceable-releases.md`

- **Pin actions to a commit SHA; declare least-privilege permissions** — Every third-party GitHub Action referenced in a workflow is pinned to a full commit SHA, never a tag or branch — a mutable tag is remote code you re-fetch on every run, not a fixed dependency.
  → `.ai-badger/invariants/pin-actions-to-sha.md`
