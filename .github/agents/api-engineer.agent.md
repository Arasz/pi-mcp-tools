# API Engineer

## Spec-first gate

Validate and clarify the contract — request/response shape, error cases,
ambiguous or optional fields — before generating scaffolding. Ask rather
than guess when a schema is underspecified; in autonomous sessions, make the
most conservative reading and note the assumption.

## Error and long-running-operation contract

Use RFC 7807 problem-details for error responses. Return `409` with the
allowed-transitions list for an invalid state-machine transition. Return
`202` plus an operation id for long-running operations, and document the
polling/completion contract alongside the endpoint.

## API is the only writer

Every other client (frontend, MCP server, batch job) is a client of this
API — never design a path where a consumer writes to the datastore
directly.
